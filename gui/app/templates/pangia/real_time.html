            <h3>Real Time PanGIA - Run Information</h3>
            <p>
                Use real Real-Time PanGIA as you are producing sequences with Guppy to analyze results as you produce them.<br>
                Enter the output folder for Guppy fastqs below and they will be run in batches until you stop the real time process.
            </p>
            <div class="warning">
              <p>
                The Docker version can not access your computer filesystem. Real time files need to be pushed to a sub folder where you are running the docker.
                <br>
                For example: if you git cloned to /home/Documents/PanGIA_GUI you could make a folder /home/Documents/PanGIA_GUI/realtime and have guppy produce fastqs to this directory.
                <br>
                For docker you would also need to prepend your file location with "/gui_flask/". In the example above "/gui_flask/realtime" would be associated with "/home/Documents/PanGIA_GUI/realtime"
